<h1>What Is BloxBot?</h1>

<p>
    Let's face it: School isn't fun. You have to sit for 8 hours every day and listen carefully to what someone is telling you.
    Then you have a million people telling you all this information is important, but you're just wondering "When am I ever gonna use this?!"
<br>
    <br>
    Enter BloxBot.
<br>
    <br>
    We're a revolutionary idea in how we handle STEM education. We're not lecturing, we're discovering. We're opening up a whole new way of thinking about science and mathematics. And we're doing it with
    Legos.
</p>

<h2>Primary Objectives</h2>

<p>
    We're looking to link the various worlds of STEM education. Currently, most students don't learn the connections between Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. Even worse, most of the
    study is theoretical, making it harder to see where you'll use it.
